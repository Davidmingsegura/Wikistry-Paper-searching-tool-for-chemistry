# **Wikistry: Paper Searching Tool for Chemistry**

## **Overview**
Wikistry is an agent tool designed to search for scientific papers related to chemistry from various sources and perform summarization. Currently, the project successfully fetches articles from **arXiv**, while support for other sources such as **ACS (American Chemical Society)** are under development. The tool aims to automate literature searches and extract key information like **titles, abstract, links and summarization using BART model** to research papers.

## **Features**
- âœ… **Fetch research articles from arXiv** based on a query.
- âœ… **Summarizes the abstract of research articles from arXiv** based on BART model.
- ðŸ”„ **Work in progress:** Automating article retrieval from ACS (abstract extraction needs improvement).
- ðŸ›  **Uses Selenium for web scraping** (ACS) and API-based retrieval (arXiv).
- ðŸ“„ **Outputs structured data** (title, summary and link) for easy reference.

## **Installation**
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Wikistry-Paper-searching-tool-for-chemistry.git
   cd Wikistry-Paper-searching-tool-for-chemistry
   ```

2. **Set up a Python virtual environment** :
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv my_environment
   source my_environment/bin/activate  # On Windows: my_environment\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **(For ACS support) Install ChromeDriver**:
   - Download the correct **ChromeDriver** for your OS [here](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/).
   - Place it in the project directory or set up the correct path in `script_agent.py`.

## **Usage**
### **Fetch Articles from arXiv**
Run the following script to search for chemistry-related papers on arXiv:
```python
from script_agent import fetch_arxiv

query = "machine learning for chemistry"
articles = fetch_arxiv(query, max_results=5)

for article in articles:
    print(f"Title: {article['title']}")
    print(f"Abstract: {article['abstract']}")
    print(f"Link: {article['link']}")
    print("-" * 80)
```

### **Fetch Articles from ACS (Under Development)**
Currently, ACS abstracts are not being extracted correctly. The function attempts to scrape **ACS publications**, but abstracts are often missing due to dynamic loading or paywalls.
```python
from script_agent import fetch_acs_articles_selenium

query = "machine learning for chemistry"
articles = fetch_acs_articles_selenium(query, max_results=5)

for article in articles:
    print(f"Title: {article['title']}")
    print(f"Abstract: {article['abstract']}")
    print(f"Link: {article['link']}")
    print("-" * 80)
```
